# Buggary
The premiere bug writing tool! Still a work in progress.

Buggary is a code editor that runs directly in unity. It has:
* Code completion.
* Compile time error overlay.
* Shows overload options [When the cursor is on a method with overloads].
* Detailed customizable code highlighting(coloring) [There is a BuggaryColors scriptable object that can be edited].
* Can generate using statements for unrecognized types [This is triggered by ctrl+.];

Buggary is also a game, where you have to write code to complete challenges. There are three example levels currently you can go trough.
